I chose Option 2:  SMS chatbot with OpenAI and Twilio, following the instructions from this 
website: https://www.twilio.com/blog/openai-gpt-3-chatbot-python-twilio-smsLinks to an external site.



For this assigment I had to build a chatbot which wasn't to bad actually as long as I remeber what im doing.
For example don't save your file as Chatbot.py then try and call chatbot.py before you realize you capitalized the first letter

1. Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine.
2. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a virtual environment by running the command python -m venv venv.
4. Activate the virtual environment by running the command venv\Scripts\activate on Windows or source venv/bin/activate on Linux/Mac.
5. Install the required packages by running the command pip install -r requirements.txt.
6. Create a new file named .env in the project directory and set your OpenAI API key as OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key.
7. Run the command python app.py to start the chatbot.
Send a message to your Twilio phone number and the chatbot will respond with an answer to your question.
If you encounter any issues, make sure that your API key is valid and that you have activated the virtual environment before running the chatbot.


You have to set up a twilio account. 
Openai account.
I included the python files. The test files to see if your api key is working.


If you want to take it a set further in the code you can code it on python using pycharm and set it up so it can send sms text from your python to your phone in sms.
